<br>

Next iteration of the aAAVE token (Aave v3), optimized for its usage as voting asset on Aave Governance v3.

In addition to the inherited implementation from Aave v3, the new logic on aAAVE respects the same properties as the new AAVE token, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-token-v3/blob/main/properties.md)

<br>

## Setup

This repository requires having Foundry installed in the running machine. Instructions on how to do it [HERE](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).

After having installed Foundry:
1. Add a `.env` file with properly configured `RPC_MAINNET`, following the example on `.env.example`
2. `make test` to run the simulation tests.
